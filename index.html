            <p>They suffer from malnutrition, can not go to school and have no prospect of a better future. Many of them do not even experience their fifth birthday. The children in Africa need help - here you will find facts and figures that concern us
                all. Over 400 million children are currently living on the African continent - and the number is rising. The United Nations estimates that Africa's population will double to 2.4 billion by 2050. That's one quarter of the world's population.
                40 percent of all children under the age of five would live in Africa in the middle of the 21st century, according to the prognosis. Growing up without a mother and father - that's the sad reality for 15 million children in sub-Saharan
                Africa. The disease HIV / AIDS has taken one or even both parents. They live with relatives or on the street, without a home. Many of the AIDS orphans were also infected with the treacherous virus while still in the womb or during birth
                or breastfeeding. A large number of AIDS orphans live in South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Timely education and medication could significantly reduce the number of new infections in Africa.
